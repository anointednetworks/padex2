      <ResourceParagraph>
        An annuity is an agreement where you pay a premium (either a lump sum or multiple payments) to an insurance
        company, and in return, they promise to make payments to you either now or in the future. The interest your
        money earns while it's in the annuity grows tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on it until you start
        receiving payouts or take withdrawals. These payments can continue for a set period or for the rest of your life,
        helping ensure you have income even if you live longer than expected.

      <ResourceParagraph>
        When you withdraw or get payments, that money is taxed as ordinary income. If you pull money out before you
        are 59Â½, you might face a 10% federal tax penalty on top of the regular income tax. Annuities have fees and
        charges associated with the contract, and a surrender charge also may apply if the contract owner elects to give
        up the annuity before certain time-period conditions are satisfied.

          "Fixed Annuities: Guaranteed payments regardless of market performance",

      <ResourceParagraph>
        Annuities can provide income you cannot outlive, helping ensure financial security throughout retirement. Consult a financial advisor to determine if an annuity fits your retirement plan.
